         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The perſwaſion whereof hath incouraged vs to bring forth our prouiſion, and to ſet before thee ſuch foode as God hath inabled vs to prepare. We reſt aſſured of thy Chriſtian loue towards vs, &amp; prouidence for thine owne ſoule, that thou wilt be more affected with the matter of this treatiſe, being, as we hope, ſound, and without corruption, then offended with the manner thereof, being homely, and without elegan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. As in expounding this Scripture to our owne flocks, we reſpected the capacitie of our vnlearned hearers, ſo in publiſhing the ſame to others, we tender the profit of the ſimpleſt readers. And as for them that are iudicious, and Godly learned, we preſume that their owne knowledge, &amp; the reading of more excellent diſcourſes, will miniſter wiſdome, to make their vſe of this ſlender worke, as this worke will giue them occaſion to eſteeme the better of more excellent diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. We haue thought good to chooſe theſe two Chapters to beginne with, though almoſt in the middeſt of the booke, that we might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to thee a patterne of the expoſition of both ſorts of parables, aſwell of ſuch as are ſet downe in forme of a treatiſe, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued diſcourſe, as of thoſe which are for the moſt part ſingle ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. If thou ſhalt iudge, that there may be any fruit of theſe trauels,
<pb facs="tcp:10281:4"/> we are minded, if God will, to explicate the reſt; but by parts, and at ſeuerall times, and not all entirely together. Now in reading of this, obſerue that the reaſons and vſes of the points, are not inferred vpon the allegations, or amplifications, immediately going before, but depend vpon the propoſitions which are the doctrines raiſed out of the ſeuerall verſes: And into them are we compelled to enter ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly without any precedent introduction to lead vs, leaſt we ſhuld either weary our ſelues in ſeeking varietie of preambles, or wearie thee with innumerable tautologies and repetitions. In the printing, the pointing in ſundry places is miſplaced, which in reading thou ſhalt eaſily finde, and we hope wilt eaſily redreſſe.</p>
            <p>The God of mercie grant thee that grace which we can but wiſh thee, and by the efficacie of his ſpirit worke in thine heart the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and power of this his holy word, which we can onely by tongue and penne declare vnto thee. Amen.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Killed her vitailes, &amp;c.</hi> The beſt cheere is that which is <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> made for the ſoule in Gods houſe: which is declared by diuers <note place="margin">The ſoules food is the beſt fare.</note> circumſtances in the Parable of the great feaſt. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 2. 3. As that it was made by a King; and therefore not common, but coſtly according to his royall ſtate and greatneſſe: and was alſo a wedding feaſt; which is vſually great and full of ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie: and made at the marriage of his owne ſonne; which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently would cauſe it to bee much more ſumptuous and magnificent, then if it had beene for a ſeruant or kinſman, or ordinary perſon.

               <p>One reaſon to proue this doctrine is, the reſemblance and <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>1</label> agreement that is betweene the ſpirituall foode and corporall meates: it is delightfull to the ſoule as they bee to the ſence: that reuiueth the afflicted and troubled conſcience, as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh the ſpirits of a faint and feeble perſon; and addeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of ſtrength and ſtature to the inward man, as they doe to the outward.</p>
               <p>Another reaſon is, the differences that are betweene them, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> wherein this heauenly &amp; celeſtiall banquet doth far ſurmount the earthly. Firſt, this onely is perpetuall, day &amp; night, through the whole yeere, and whole life, and at death and euermore: whereas all others are but for a few daies, and commonly not for many houres. Secondly, heere is no ſurfet or danger by exceſſe, though wee continue eating and drinking vnceſſantly without intermiſsion; which is contrary in corporall repaſts. Thirdly, this is a durable meate, and doth miniſter an abiding nourtriture, that hee that hath once digeſted it, ſhall neuer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter periſh by hunger. Fourthly this doth not onely ſuſtaine life for a time, but giue it and preſerue it for euer. Fiftly, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as all other meates and drinkes, though neuer ſo plentifull, are
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:10281:7"/> onely for the belly, and helpe againſt nothing but the preſent hunger and thirſt; this bringeth with it ſafetie, wealth, digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and all happineſſe.

               <p>Confutation of ſuch as ſtand vpon the merit of man for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation: <label type="milestone">

The vnrighteous trade and courſe of getting is to many a kinde of ſauce to procure a reliſh to their poſſeſsions. They eſteeme euery thing to bee ſo much the more worth, if a craftie head, a violent hand, a guilefull tongue, or any fraudulent meanes hath brought it vnto them. The ſame proportion holdeth in all other caſes. How many bee carried with brutiſh luſts and affections to ſtrange fleſh, that haue nothing in them of beautie, and in the meane time loath their owne wiues which bee well fauoured, perſonable, and comely: and who almoſt taketh delight in any recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is neither vnſeaſonable in reſpect of the time, nor yet vnwarrantable in regard of the manner, yet it is altogether too freſh and vnſauery for their taſte, vnleſſe the Diuell pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it with ſome enormious abuſes.</p>

                  </label> parents doe beare vnto God, that thinking all too little that is done in his ſeruices, they haue now helpers euen out of their owne loynes, that will ioyne with them in the ſame: and when they haue finiſhed their courſe and ended their owne daies worke, yet the worke ſhall ſtill bee continued by their poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. We ſee in humane affaires, that euery good ſubiect will be glad to breede vp a ſonne that will bee ſit and able to ſerue his ſoueraigne: and how can it then but cheere vp the heart and refreſh the ſpirits of Chriſtian fathers or mothers to haue their children the Lords Souldiers, valiantly ſighting his bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes againſt ſinne and Sathan, and that in their owne ſight and preſence? euery good maſter, as was <hi>Abraham,</hi> will think it a benefite to haue his ſeruants to be the ſeruants of the Lord: and euery Chriſtian will gladly heare of Godly men, in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther familie, in another towne, in another countrie, in another

               <p>Secondly, loue to the people of God will worke gladneſſe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> when faithfull men diſcerne their children to bee inclining to goodneſſe. For they are growing to be fruitfull plants in the Lords orchard, and ſo many ſhall haue profit by them many waies, whereas the wicked are as thornes and bryars and noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome brambles.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the happy condition of gracious and godly chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> themſelues doth procure to the parents much conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for beſides their ſpirituall promotion and dignitie, being made the ſonnes of God, and kingly heires of euerlaſting glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the fauour and bleſsing of God doth vſually appeare to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them for the things of this life: when rebellious and wicked children haue the curſe of God vpon them, doing miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe and hurt, and receiuing the reward of it, by ſhame and infamy, by debts and arearages, by ſlight and lurking, by bonds and impriſonment, and oftentimes by an ignominious death and deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, wiſe children yeeld matter of comfort to their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> in being officious vnto them, and vſing all good behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our towards them: for they are moſt forward to obay their commandements, they are moſt cheerefull to releeue their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsities: they are moſt faithfull and prouident to preſerue their life, and health, and welfare. In which reſpect the Scripture compareth them to arrowes or any other weapons, whereby

And as they are preſt and ready to performe euery duetie that is required of them, ſo will they alſo carefully regard their parents dealings towards them: the father giueth counſell, and the ſonne is directed by it: the father giueth rebuke and the ſonne trembleth at it: the father giueth correction, and the ſonne doth humbly ſubmit himſelfe vnto it. Now at the handes of a fooliſh child, what is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, but folly: contempt of commaundements and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell: murmuring againſt admonition and reproofes: reſiſtance againſt correction and chaſtiſements? if their parents bee in wants, they are aſhamed of them, and thincke it an intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble burthen to bee charged with them: and ſo ſhorten their dayes by opprobtious and hard vſage: if they haue wealth, they ſeeke to make a ſpoyle of them: if they be like to leaue them patrimonie or inheritance, no enemie doth ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire their death: if they bee ſimple and want vnderſtanding, they eyther vſe contemptuouſly to checke and ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Inſtruction, Firſt, to children to take it as a motiue to ſtirre <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>1</label> them vp, &amp; prouoke them to Chriſtian conuerſation, that they ſhal miniſter comfort to their parents, and pleaſure themſelues, and pleaſe the Lord: for all thoſe concurre and meete toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one. The ſonne doth neuer giue iuſt occaſion of glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to his father, but hee hath a iuſt cauſe to be glad for his owne ſake; becauſe God hath ſo ſeaſoned him with grace, and made him acceptable to his friends, and vouchſafed vnto him his owne fauour. Whereas on the contrary ſide when the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents are much grieued for the childes miſdemeanours, the child ought to bee more grieued for his owne wretchedneſſe; for he ſhall bee moſt puniſhed for his rebellion. Secondly, to parents that for as much as their childrens vice, or vertue is their woe or welfare, therefore they doe their beſt indeauour to haue their ſeede to be vertuous and holy. And he that will <note place="margin">How a man may be a ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full father.</note> doe this, muſt lay the foundation of beeing a comfortable fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, beefore hee bee a father, and take the way to haue good
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:10281:28"/> children, beefore hee haue children: and that is by a due care that himſelfe doe marry in the Lord: that he propoſe ſuch an ende, and vſe ſuch proceeding, and match with ſuch a wife, as will bring the bleſsing of God vpon his houſe and poſteritie. Secondly, if he be deſirous that his children ſhould yeeld him the crop of comfort, he muſt beſtow vpon them the ſeede of inſtruction, and the tillage of good education. Thirdly, great care is to be had for the wiſe and orderly diſpoſing of them in marriage, that all the former hopes be not cut off through the neglect of this dutie: For diuers times good people in this regard are like to corne that proſpereth well in the blade, but afterwards is either blaſted or withered in the eare. Many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious and towardly young men and maidens haue beene vtterly ouerthrowne by coupling themſelues to profane yoke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellowes, and being ingrafted into ſinfull families.</p>
               <p>Reproofe of thoſe that take leaſt care to get wiſedome for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> their children, but onely labour to prouide them wealth, and thereby they are made idle, and proude, and vnthriftie, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to waſt with riot all that they haue gotten with care and trauell. And yet they bee far worſe and altogether vnworthie of the name of fathers, that grieue at the graces of the children, and reſtraine them from all the meanes whereby they might attaine vnto knowledge and wiſedome.</p>
               <p>Conſolation to them that be inriched with this treaſure of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> good children, howſoeuer the world goeth with them in their ſtate otherwiſe. If they be wealthy and ſtored with poſſeſsions, they haue ſuch to leaue them vnto, as are fitted for them, and know how to vſe them, and are like long to inioy them. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as many parents doe leaue portions that are better than the children to whom they are beequeathed: and the good crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God are put into the hands of vnworthie men, who are therefore vnable long to retaine them. If they be pore and deſtitute of other riches, &amp; maintenance, yet the want of things of leſſe value, is ſupplied by that which is of more worth, one good child is better then many wedges of gold: and no earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inheritance is ſo faire a demaines, as a religious ſeede, which God doth giue in goodneſſe, and by his owne teſtimonie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth

               <p>But if it be ſaid, that thus far it profiteth them to bee weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie, that they eate and drinke and liue thereby: our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our anſweareth that no mans life conſiſteth in the abundance of his riches: doe not poore men liue alſo? are not ſheepe, and <note place="margin">Luke. 12. 15.</note> kine, and all other cattell nouriſhed?</p>

And for this cauſe the Prophet <hi>Habbakuk</hi> doth cry out ſhame vpon their follie, when they thinke themſelues to bee very wiſe and prudent; <hi>Ho, hee that</hi>

Or let the beſt be made of it, and be it their owne, yet their owne is nothing but a loade of heauy morter. And this were well if this were all; but the worſt remayneth to bee ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of: namely their burdens of wicked treaſures bee as it were bags or purſes obtayned by ſtealth, or robberie, which will therefore bring their liues into perill.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the abundance of outward things cannot ſuccour <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> them in the time of their calamitie: for ſo the Prophet threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth; <hi>Neither their ſiluer nor their gold ſhall bee able to deliuer them in the day of the Lords wrath Zeph.</hi> 1. 18. If their danger grew from the heat of mens wrath there might bee hope that wealth would help them: for either a ſumme of mony would quench the flame of the aduerſaries diſpleaſure, or kindle cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in ſome others to defend them. But now that God is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked againſt them, it is in vaine to offer gold or ſiluer to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie him or to ranſome themſelues; for hee ſtandeth in no <note place="margin">Pſal. 49. 7.</note>

Then to oppoſe them againſt him, in way of reſiſtance, it were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd: for there is no power in them to doe vs good without him: and much leſſe therefore to maintaine any man againſt him. Nay they be ſo far from ayding ſinfull men againſt the <note place="margin">Pſal. 62. 10 11.</note> hand of God, as that they bee many times weapons in their hand; to plague them with ſtroaks of iudgement. It hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer beene heard that the purſe hath preſerued the man from the ſword of the robber, or the cheſt from the aſſault of the theefe: but the contrary falleth out often, that men bee made a ſpoile for their money, and brought to ruine, as a tree that hath great bowes and a little roote is ouerturned in a mightie tempeſt. But there eſpecially doth wealth bring woe to wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, when God awaketh their conſciences, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This verſe alſo containeth an anſwere to an other obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which might riſe out of the words immediately going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: if food and maintenance be the gift of God, and they that haue little ſhall be kept from want, and they that haue great ſtore ſhall bee ſtript of all, to what end ſhould men trauell and take paines? the wiſeſt way is to giue ouer all labour. Now this hee refuteth by ſhewing the meanes whereby righteous men vſe to receiue this food and prouiſion from Gods hand, and that is by ſedulitie and diligence in their vocations. And therefore he demonſtrateth the contrary effects of contrary men, namely, of ſlouthfull perſons, and ſuch as be induſtrious, and painefull. Slothfull perſons fall into two euills, the one is the practiſe of deceitfulneſſe, called heere a deceitfull hand,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:10281:34"/> the other is the burthen of pouertie, which is a puniſhment inflicted vpon them, both for fraud and idleneſſe. They that bee diligent haue their reward yeelded vnto them, that they thriue, and proſper by the labour of their hands: and though their wealth bee not ſo great in quantitie, yet the ſmalneſſe thereof is recompenſed in qualitie, and good vſe of it, and therefore is called precious riches. Chap. 12. 27. And ſo they haue neither neede nor diſpoſition to giue themſelues to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull ſhifts, as ſluggards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A deceitfull hand, &amp;c.</hi> Falſe dealing is no profitable trade <label type="milestone">

The riches of vanitie ſhall bee diminiſhed, they may bee gotten, but not long kept, and though they periſh not, nor bee taken away all at once, yet they will conſume and bee waſted by degrees. And as this euent is heere decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to come vpon euill gotten goods, ſo in an other place hee telleth the miſerie that ſhall ouertake the men themſelues, that ſo fiſh for them. Chap. 19. 15. <hi>A deceitfull perſon ſhall bee affamiſhed.</hi> As wealth will forſake them, ſo friends will faile them, and God will curſe them, and pouertie will oppreſſe them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Lord doth hate, and curſe both deceit, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuers, <label type="milestone">

               <p>Secondly, conſider from whence very often this deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> proceedeth, from idleneſſe and remiſneſſe of men in their callings, as many texts doe teſtifie, and the antitheſis eſpecially, and oppoſition in the two places before alleadged. Now if ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle ſloathfulneſſe of it ſelfe will ſo eate vp a mans eſtate, as heereafter is to bee ſhewed, much more when it hath ſuch a companion to take part with it. And for experience heereof, looke vpon gameſters, and conſoners, and ſhifters, and all ſuch kinde of people, and ſee whether their owne negligence, and vniuſt courſes doe not like hungry and greedy beaſtes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and ſwallow vp all their portions.</p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:10281:35"/>
               <p> Thirdly, it is a righteous thing with God ſo to requite <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> them with penurie, that by fraud, and falſehood ſeeke to bring other men to it.</p>
               <p>Inſtruction, if wee bee viſited with beggerie or needineſſe <label type="milestone">

               <p>Secondly, wee be yet ſpared from the ſtroak of God, that he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> hath not arreſted our ſubſtance being forfaited by falſehoode, nor depriued vs of the ſame. Let vs then ſpeedely preuent the puniſhment by breaking off the ſinne by repentance, by mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, by reformation and reſtitution to the right owners, ſo far as poſsibly wee ſhall be able.</p>
               <p>Reproofe of their folly which hope to inrich themſelues by deceit and wrongfull dealing, truſting to riſe by that which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> bringeth others to a fall, and to turne that to a gaine, which is to others a loſſe. But by triall they ſhall bee taught, that they may as well looke to thriue by vnthriftineſſe, as to increaſe their ſtock by deceit: or profit themſelues by rapine, and wrong doeing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> But it appeareth that their ſucceſſe is correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to their expectation, the euent proueth that they make a gaine of it. The Prophet teſtifieth, that as a cage is full of Birds, ſo their houſes are full of deceit, and thereby they are <note place="margin">Ierem. 5. 27.</note> become great, and waxen rich.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwere,</hi> They may get things into their hands, and yet be preuented of the fruition of them. They may haue them for a time, and loſe them at the laſt, as the ſame Prophet alſo tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth: as the Partridge gathereth, or layeth egges, and hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <note place="margin">Ier. 17. 11.</note> not, ſo he that getteth riches, and not by right ſhall leaue them in the middeſt of his daies, and in the end dye like a foole. They haue not a broode of comforts, ſo ſoone as they ſit vpon their neſt of riches, they may be trodden vpon, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:10281:35"/> or eaten vp. Euill may befall them beefore they can doe them any good, or if their goods remaine, themſelues may ſoone be remoued from their goods: and in the meane time haue the croſſe of God on ſoule, &amp; bodie, which is much more grieuous, then to be ſmitten in outward eſtate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the hand of the diligent, &amp;c.</hi> They greatly help their <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> owne eſtate that are painefull, and faithfull in their vocations. <note place="margin">A man faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling betters his eſtate.</note> Among many teſtimonies whereby this point is confirmed, that is to be noted which is in the 13. Chapter of this booke. <hi>The ſoule of the diligent ſhall haue plentie, or be made fat,</hi> as the <note place="margin">Prouerb. 13. 4.</note> word ſignifieth. Where though by ſoule he vnderſtandeth the whole man, yet that part is not named in vaine. Their bodie, and outward man ſhall haue inough, and the ſoule and inward man ſhall be content and ſatisfied with inough, and much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed by it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it is appointed to man by the decree of God, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſons. </seg>1</label> as a dutie to trauell, and labour, but alſo as a portion to eate his bread thereby, and inioy the fruit of his labour, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 19. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 128. 2.</p>
               <p>Secondly, diligence, and painefulneſſe, is a ſeruice to God, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and they that here haue the promiſe made to them, are ſuch as performe their works in conſcience, and obedience to his will, &amp; therfore may wel be aſſured of allowance to maintain them. As for ſuch as work for the worlds ſake, in pride, and couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or vpon coaction and neceſsitie, or for any other ſiniſter reſpect, they may be ſaid to be great doers that medle in much dealing, but nothing diligent: and therefore it is no maruell, though all their toyle and trauell doe ſeldome take any good effect.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, their paines and labours are for the common good, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> they ſerue for the vſe and profit of mankinde, (for they that ſpinne the ſpiders web, and are more buſie then well occupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are not to be counted in the number of theſe) and therfore ſhall not faile of the benefit of it themſelues.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, faithfull imployment, and paines taking is a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> againſt pride, and helpeth to worke humilitie, and <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 1. 13.</note> therefore maketh ready the way for all good proſperitie.</p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:10281:36"/>
               <p> Fiftly, by this meanes they are kept from vicious compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and ſinfull exerciſes, and all kinde of ſuch vnthriftie courſes, as whereby the ſtates of many men come to vtter ruine and ouerthrow.</p>

Chap. 14. 23. And albeit now thou art at the commandement of others, and according to their wils art wholy vſed in their workes, yet remember that the hand of the diligent ſhall beare rule.

               <p>It is a matter of great importance to make our vſe of a good <label type="milestone">

Hee that may truely be ſaid to poſſeſſe the bleſsing, cannot poſsibly ſay how much he doth poſſeſſe: The varietie of his treaſure is vnſpeakeable: his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:10281:38"/> exceedeth all eſtimation: his inheritance is endleſſe, and without all bounds and limits. Though wee ſhould be as much moleſted with malitious men, as <hi>Dauid,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> were, and as much aſſaulted by Sathan and tryed by Gods owne hand, with loſſes, or bodily infirmities, as <hi>Iob</hi> was; yet if we be bleſſed of God as they were, what cauſe can there be of feare, or griefe, or diſcontentment? The bleſsing bringeth ſtrength for ſupportance in them: the bleſsing bringeth iſſue and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance out of them, the bleſsing worketh the right vſe of them: the bleſsing yeeldeth a plentifull reward, of comfort and good proſperitie in this life, and of glorie and euerlaſting happineſſe in the life to come.</p>
               <p>When God entreth into iudgement with wicked men, hee <label type="milestone">

Though hipocrites can make the greateſt ſhew, and vſuallie bee moſt forward to ſpeake for themſelues: yet when God found out the diſſembler in the Goſpell, and called him to a reckoning for intruding himſelfe to his feaſt without a wedding garment, he was ſtriken dumme <note place="margin">Mat. 22. 12.</note> and ſpeechleſſe, hee could plead nothing for himſelfe. <hi>Haman</hi> ſtanding onely before the miniſter of Gods vengeance, hauing beene before that time his greateſt friend, yet when <hi>Heſter</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed <note place="margin">Heſt. 7. 6.</note> him of his falſe and cruel practices: he ſtoode mute, and could not reply. He that attempted to ſtop the mouth of <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docai,</hi> had his owne mouth ſtopped with his violence. And therefore when God himſelfe commeth to indite men, and to ſet their ſinnes in order before them, all mouthes ſhall be ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, <note place="margin">Pſal. 50. 21.</note> and all the world ſhall be culpable before him.

               <p>Admonition, not to aduenture to commit ſuch ſinnes as <label type="milestone">

And this wee ſhall doe, if wee labour to know all that God would haue vs to learne, &amp; to indeuor to practiſe all that wee know, and to confeſſe to God all that we faile to practiſe: for ſo farre as wee are willingly ignorant of any dutie, or care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe to performe it, or ſecure when we neglect it, &amp; conceale <note place="margin">Pſal. 32. 2. 3.</note> our ſinnes, not acknowledging them that the Lord may remit them: ſo far wee come ſhort of a good conſcience.</p>

And let power and courage concur to gether, yet both wilbe inſufficient to ſtrengthen a heart that Gods iudgement, and their owne guiltineſſe doe weaken. As <hi>Balſhazzar</hi> being bold to defie Cyrus, and to bid battell to the Lord himſelfe, profaning his holy veſſells in deſpight of him: yet now in the middeſt of iolitie, amongſt his friends, in his owne houſe, in a ſtrong cittie, garded with an hoaſt of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſouldiers, hee was ſo frighted, and terrified, that his countenance was changed, his heart was reſolued into daſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardlineſſe, the ioyntes of his loynes were looſed, and his knees ſmote one againſt an other. And what was it that ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him? the ſight of an hand, writing vpon the wall. There were neither more enemies, nor fewer friends, nor any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alteration then beefore, but God wakened his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and his conſcience ſhewed him his guiltineſſe, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether threatned his deſtruction, and heereby his great cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage was ſo quickly killed.
